# Prototyping

You can fork [this codepen](https://codepen.io/oslokommune/pen/zbLXbV) and start experimenting by copy and pasting html from the different patterns into your
codepen fork.

The codepen is set up with a cdn without versioning, so be aware that the contents
of the cdn will change over time. We are planning to support versioned cdns in the future.

If you want to use the cdn in a different environment, copy this line into the head
section of your html:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://styleguide.oslo.kommune.no/styleguide.css">
```
