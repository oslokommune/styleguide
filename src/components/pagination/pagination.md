Note: from page 100 and onwards, remove `osg-button--circle`.

As a guideline, you should have a maximum of 7 links/buttons within the next / previous arrows (spacers do not count).

If you have <= 7 pages in total, you do not need to add spacers.

On the first and last page, you should have a maximum of 6 links.
