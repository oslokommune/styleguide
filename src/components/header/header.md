You can extend the header with more `<div class="column">Your nice content</div>` after the logo. See the <a href="https://bulma.io/documentation/columns/basics/" target="_blank">Bulma grid</a> for options.

The `<a>` surrounding the logo/SVG can be removed.
Usually there will be no link at the front page, but a link back to the front page on all other pages.
