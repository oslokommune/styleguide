The `<a>` surrounding the logo/SVG can be removed.
Usually there will be no link at the front page, but a link back to the front page on all other pages.

Padding around the logo must be a minimum of 20px (design rule).

See https://designmanual.oslo.kommune.no/oslologo for extensive rules about the use of the logo.
